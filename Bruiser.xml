		<description>
			<p>At 1st level, your life of scrapping and battling with beasts, humans, or other tough creatures has given you mastery of Combat styles that use unarmed strikes and bruiser weapons, which are simple melee weapons without the two-handed property, cutlasses, and improvised weapons. You can not use the finesse property of a weapon while using it as a bruiser weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only bruiser Weapons and you aren’t wearing armor and not wielding a shield:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or bruiser weapon. This die changes as you gain bruiser levels, as shown in the scrapper column on the bruiser table.</li>
				<li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a bruiser weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike or grapple as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and Attack with a Club, you can also make an Unarmed Strike or grapple as a Bonus Action, assuming you haven’t already taken a Bonus Action this turn.</li>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 2nd Level, your Training allows you to harness Fury, raw power and energy that stems from your spirit. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of Fury points. Your bruiser level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Fury Points column of the Bruiser table.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can spend these points to fuel various Fury features. You start knowing three such features: Machine Gun Blows, Brute Force, and Brace for Impact. You learn more Fury features as you gain levels in this class.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you spend a Fury point, it is unavailable until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended Fury back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest training to regain your Fury points.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some of your Fury features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s Effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
			<p class="indent">Fury save DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Constitution modifier</p>
			<strong>Machine Gun Blows</strong>
			<p>Immediately after you take the Attack action on Your Turn, you can spend 1 fury point to make two unarmed strikes or bruiser weapon attacks as a Bonus Action.</p>
			<strong>Brute Force</strong>
			<p>You can use a bonus action and expend 1 fury point to make a shove attack or take the Dash action.</p>
			<strong>Brace for Impact</strong>
			<p>You can use your Fury to grit your teeth and withstand physical injuries. You can use a bonus action and spend 1 fury point to prepare for any incoming attack. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your scrapper die + your bruiser level.</p>
		</description>

			<description>When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</description>

In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</p>
